# Waterfall Model
1. Requirement Gathering and analysis
    - To capture all possible requirements of the system to be developed.
2. System Design
    - Helps in designing the overall system architecture.
3. Implementation
4. Integration and Testing
    - To test the system and ensure that it is working as expected.
5. Deployment
    - To deploy the system to the end user.
6. Maintenance
    - To fix issues that may arise during the development process.

## Advantages 
- Simple and easy to use.
- Easy to manage due to the `rigidity` (死板) of the model.
- Phases are completed/processed at a time.
- Easy to arrange task.
- Works well with smaller projects.

## Disadvantages
- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
- High amounts of risk.
- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented project.

### Where is Waterfall suitable?
- Requirements are clear.
- Product definition is stable.
- Small project (2 - 4 months).
- No ambiguous requirements.
- Technology is well understood.

# V-Model
![V-Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_v_model.jpg)
1. Requirement analysis -> Acceptance Test Design
    - If the client is not clear about the requirements, the `Acceptance Test Design` is done at this stage. The Bussiness Requirement can be used as input for the acceptance testing.
2. System Design -> System Testing
    - `System Testing` is based on `System Design`. 
3. Architecture Design -> Integration Testing
4. Module Design -> Unit Testing
5. Coding
